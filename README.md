# **Finding Edges in Images**

## **AIM**
The objective of this MATLAB script is to find the edges in a grayscale image by applying the following edge detection operators:
1. Laplacian Operator
2. Unsharp Masking
3. Highboost Filtering

---

## **Features**
This MATLAB script performs the following tasks:
- Converts an image to grayscale (if not already grayscale).
- Applies various Laplacian filters with different center coefficients.
- Enhances image sharpness using Unsharp Masking.
- Performs Highboost Filtering to improve image details.
- Displays and compares results visually.

---

## **How to Use**
1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Ensure MATLAB (R2020b or later) and the Image Processing Toolbox are installed.
3. Run the script `lab09_edges.m` in MATLAB.
4. The script will display the results of different edge detection methods including Laplacian, Unsharp Masking, and Highboost Filtering.

---

## **Prerequisites**
- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- Image Processing Toolbox.
---

## **Instructions**
1. Save the file as `lab09_edges.m`.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script in MATLAB by typing `lab09_edges` in the command window.
4. The script will:
   - Read and convert the input image to grayscale.
   - Apply Laplacian filters with different coefficients.
   - Perform Unsharp Masking with different kernel sizes.
   - Apply Highboost Filtering with different boost factors.
   - Display the processed images in separate figure windows.
